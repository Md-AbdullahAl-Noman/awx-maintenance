The file /autoworx-maintenance/autoworx-maintenance/public/favicon.ico should contain the favicon image data. Since I cannot generate binary data for an image file, you will need to create or obtain a favicon image and save it as favicon.ico in the specified directory.

Please ensure that the favicon.ico file is placed in the public directory of your project.
